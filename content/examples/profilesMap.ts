        description: 'A degenerate Orca Feral Hybrid.',
        lore: 'Shylily is a YouTuber with a dark past. Born as an Orca, she was captured by a group of hunters and sold into captivity. She was then experimented on by a mad scientist, who fused her DNA with that of a human. The result was a feral hybrid that was too unstable to be released into the wild. She was kept in a secret government facility until she escaped, and now she lives in the sewers, surviving on a diet of rats and garbage. She is able to transform into a human form, but the transformation is painful and leaves her weak. She uses her human form to make videos, in which she rants about the state of the world and her hatred of humans.',
